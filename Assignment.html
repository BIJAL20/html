   <h2 align="left">Q-1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h2><hr>
   <h4 align="left"> HTML Teg:</h4>
   <p>HTML tags are used to define the structure and layout of the content within an HTML document. They are surrounded by angled brackets, such as &lt;html&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, etc. Each tag corresponds to a specific element or component of the web page, such as a paragraph, image, link, header, footer, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h4 align="left">HTML Elements:</h4>
    <p align="left">HTML elements, on the other hand, are made up of the opening and closing tags, and the content or information that is placed between them. For example, the &lt;p&gt; tag is used to define a paragraph element, and the opening tag &lt;p&gt; marks the beginning of the paragraph, while the closing tag &lt;/p&gt; marks the end of the paragraph.</p>

     <!-- Question 2 -->
     <h2 align="left">Q-2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h2><hr>
     <p align="left">In HTML, tags and attributes are used to define the structure and content of web pages</p> <br>
    <h4 align="left">HTML Tags:</h4>
    <p align="left">HTML tags are used to define the different components of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, etc. <br> <br> Tags are enclosed in angled brackets and can have attributes that provide additional information about the tag. <br> <br> For example, the &lt;img&gt; tag is used to insert images into a web page and has attributes such as "src" (to specify the URL of the image file), "alt" (to provide a text description of the image), "width" and "height" (to specify the size of the image), etc.</p>
    <h4 align="left">HTML Element:</h4>
    <p align="left">HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and can modify the behavior or appearance of the element. <br> <br>  Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an HTML element using the syntax "attribute_name=attribute_value". <br> <br> For example, the &lt;a &gt;tag is used to create hyperlinks, and the "href" attribute is used to specify the URL that the link points to. <br> <br> Other attributes such as "target", "title", "rel", etc., can also be used to modify the behavior or appearance of the hyperlink.

    <h2 align="left">Q-3. What are void elements in HTML? </h2> <hr>
    <P align="left"> The structure of each HTML tag varies. Certain elements, referred to as void elements, just need an opening tag because they themselves do not contain any elements, however the majority of elements need an opening tag, a closing tag, and contents. In this article, we'll go through how to use HTML's void elements correctly.</P>
<P align="left">A void element can have characteristics but cannot contain any content. Void elements must not have a closing tag because they automatically close.</P>
<P align="left"><B>In HTML5</B>, the following elements are void:</P>
<UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
    <LI>area</LI>
    <LI>base</LI>

<!--Question 4-->
<h2 align="left">Q-4: What are HTML Entities? </h2> <hr>
<p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters, symbols, and other non-textual content in HTML documents. <br> HTML entities are written using a special syntax of ampersand (&) followed by a unique entity name or number, and ending with a semicolon (;).</p>
<p>HTML entities are used to display characters and symbols that are reserved by HTML for specific purposes, such as angle brackets (< and >), ampersands (&), quotation marks (" and '), and other special characters that have a special meaning in HTML. <br> By using HTML entities, these reserved characters can be displayed as part of the normal text content without being interpreted as HTML markup. <br>
<br>
<ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left"> 
   <h4> Some common examples of HTML entities include:</h4>
    <br>
  <p>
&lt;  &nbsp;- less than sign  &nbsp;(& lt;) <br><br>

&gt;  &nbsp;- greater than sign &nbsp; (& gt;)<br><br>
 
&amp;  &nbsp;- ampersand &nbsp;(& amp;)<br><br>

&quot;  &nbsp;- double quotation mark &nbsp; (& quot;)<br><br>

&apos;  &nbsp;- single quotation mark &nbsp; (& apos;)<br><br>
 
&cent;  &nbsp;- cent sign &nbsp; (& cent;)<br><br>

&pound;  &nbsp;- pound sign &nbsp; (& pound;)<br><br>

&yen;  &nbsp;- yen sign &nbsp; (& yen;)<br><br>

&euro;  &nbsp;- euro sign &nbsp; (& euro;)<br><br>

&copy;  &nbsp;- copyright &nbsp; (& copy;)<br><br>

&reg;  &nbsp;- registered trademark &nbsp; (& reg;) <br><br>
  </P>
</ul>
In addition to reserved characters, HTML entities can also represent non-textual content such as mathematical symbols, currency symbols, and various special characters from different languages and scripts.
<br> <br>
Using HTML entities is important for ensuring the proper display of characters and symbols in web pages, especially when working with non-standard characters or when writing content in multiple languages.

<h2 align="left">Q-5. What are different types of lists in HTML? </h2><hr>

<p align="center">In HTML, there are three types of lists that can be used to structure and organize content: ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists.</p>

<h2>Three type list</h2>
<ul>
<p><h3>1.Ordered lists (ol):</h3><li> lists are used to present a list of items in a specific order or sequence. </li><br><li> Each item in the list is preceded by a number or letter that indicates its position in the list.</li> <br> <li>Ordered lists are created using the (ol) tag, and each item in the list is defined using the (li)tag. </li></p>
<p><h3>Examples:-</h3>
    <ul  style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </ul>
<p><h3>2.Unordered lists (ul):</h3><li> Unordered lists are used to present a list of items in no particular order or sequence.</li><br><li>Each item in the list is preceded by a bullet point or other symbol. </li><br><li> Unordered lists are created using the (ul) tag, and each item in the list is defined using the (li) tag. </li></p>
  <p><h3>Examples:-</h3>
        <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">
            <li>First item</li>
            <li>Second item</li>
            <li>Third item</li>
          </ul>
            </p>
<p><h3>3.Definition lists (dl):</h3><li>Definition lists are used to present a list of terms and their corresponding definitions.</li><br><li>Each term is defined using the (dt) tag, and its definition is defined using the (dd) tag.</li><br><li>Definition lists are created using the (dl) tag.</li> <p>
    <p><h3>Examples:-</h3></p> 
    <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">   
    <dl>
        <dt>Term 1</dt>

    </ul>
            </p>
          
            <p><li>In addition to these three types of lists, HTML also provides nested lists, where one list can be included inside another list as a list item. </li><br><li> Nested lists can be created by including a new list inside a list item using the appropriate list tag. </li></p>
          
 <!-- Question 6-->

  <h2 align="left">Q-6. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? </h2><hr>  
  <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">  
  <p>The class attribute in HTML is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. <br> The class attribute is used to group elements together based on a shared characteristic or style, which can then be targeted by CSS to apply specific styles or behaviors to all elements that belong to the same class.</p>          
<p>The class attribute can be applied to almost any HTML element, including &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; ,&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and many others. <br> To apply a class to an HTML element, simply include the class attribute in the opening tag of the element, followed by one or more class names separated by a space. <br>
<h4>Example:</h4> 
<p class="intro">This paragraph has the "intro" class.</p>
<p>In this example, the &lt;p&gt; element has been assigned the class name "intro" using the class attribute. This class name can then be targeted in CSS to apply specific styles to all paragraphs that belong to the "intro" class.</p>
</ul>
<ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left">  
<p>Multiple class names can also be assigned to the same HTML element by separating each class name with a space.</p>
<h4> Example:</h4>
<p>In this example, the &lt;p&gt; element has been assigned the class name "intro" using the class attribute. This class name can then be targeted in CSS to apply specific styles to all paragraphs that belong to the "intro" class.</p> 
</ul>
<!--<p>Multiple class names can also be assigned to the same HTML element by separating each class name with a space.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p class="intro highlight">This paragraph has the "intro" and "highlight" classes.</p>
<p>In this example, the &lt;p&gt; element has been assigned two class names: "intro" and "highlight". Both of these class names can be targeted in CSS to apply specific styles to all paragraphs that belong to either the "intro" or "highlight" classes.</p>-->
<!-- Question 7-->

<h2 align="left">Q-7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
    elements?  </h2><hr>  
    <p>In HTML, both the id and class attributes are used to identify and select elements, but they have different purposes and behaviors.</p>
  The id attribute is used to uniquely identify an element within an HTML document. <br> It must be unique, meaning no two elements in the same document can have the same id value. <br> The id attribute is typically used when you want to select a specific element for styling or scripting purposes. <br> It is often used with CSS or JavaScript to target a specific element and apply styles or perform actions on it. <br> To select an element by its id, you use the # symbol followed by the id value in CSS or JavaScript selectors.</p>
  <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left"> 
  <p>Example:
<p class="myClass">This is a paragraph element with a class</p>
<p class="myClass">This is another paragraph element with the same class</p>
</p> 
</ul>
<!-- Question 8-->

<h2 align="left">Q-8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?  </h2><hr>   
<p>In HTML, there are several formatting tags that allow you to apply various styles and formatting to your content. <br> Here are some commonly used formatting tags:</p>
<UL style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left"> <br>
 <li>&lt;b&gt;: The &lt;b&gt; tag is used to make text bold. <br>
 Example: <b>This text is bold.</b> </li><br>

<li>&lt;i&gt;: The &lt;i&gt; tag is used to make text italic. <br>
  Example: <i>This text is italicized.</i></li> <br>
  
  <li>&lt;u&gt;: The &lt;u&gt; tag is used to underline text. <br>
  Example: <u>This text is underlined.</u> </li><br>
  
  <li> &lt;s&gt;: The &lt;s&gt; tag is used to create strikethrough text.<br>
  Example: <s>This text is strikethrough.</s> </li><br>
  
  <li>&lt;strong&gt;: The &lt;strong&gt; tag is used to indicate strong emphasis, typically rendered as bold. <br>
  Example: <strong>This text has strong emphasis.</strong> </li><br>
  
  <li> &lt;em&gt;: The &lt;em&gt; tag is used to indicate emphasis, typically rendered as italic. <br>
  Example: <em>This text has emphasis.</em></li><br>
  
  <li> &lt;sup&gt;: The &lt;sup&gt; tag is used to create superscript text, appearing above the normal text line.<br>
  Example: 2<sup>nd</sup></li> <br>
  
  <li>  &lt;sub&gt;: The &lt;sub&gt; tag is used to create subscript text, appearing below the normal text line. <br>
  Example: H<sub>2</sub>O </li><br>
   
  <li> &lt;code&gt;: The &lt;code&gt; tag is used to represent computer code or programming instructions. <br>
  Example: <code>print("Hello, World!")</code> </li><br>

<h2 align="left">Q-9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?   </h2><hr>   
<p>In HTML, both cell padding and cell spacing are attributes used in table elements (table) to control the layout and spacing of cells within a table, but they have different purposes.</p>
<p><b> 1.Cell Padding:</b> Cell padding is an attribute that controls the space between the content of a cell and the cell's borders. <br> It specifies the amount of space to be added inside each cell. The cell padding is set using the cellpadding attribute within the (table) tag or through CSS. <br> It affects the space between the content of a cell and the cell's border on all sides.</p>
<ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left"> 
<p><b> Example:</b></p>
<p><table cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td>Cell 1</td>
    <td>Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>In this example, a cell padding of 5 is specified, and each cell will have 5 pixels of space between the content and the cell border.</p> <br>
</ul>
<p> <b>2.Cell Spacing:</b>Cell spacing is an attribute that controls the space between adjacent cells in a table. <br> It specifies the amount of space to be added between cells. The cell spacing is set using the cellspacing attribute within the 'table' tag or through CSS. <br> It affects the space between cells, both horizontally and vertically.</p> <br>
<ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left"> 
<p><b> Example:</b></p>
<p>
  <table cellspacing="10">
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>  
</p>
<p>In this example, a cell spacing of 10 is specified, and there will be 10 pixels of space between adjacent cells.</p>

<h2 align="left">Q-10. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
  table?   </h2><hr>
  <p>In HTML, you can merge two or more rows or columns into a single row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes in the table cells ('td' or 'th'). These attributes allow you to define the span of rows or columns that a cell should occupy.</p>
  <p>Here's how you can merge rows and columns in an HTML table: <br>
    <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left"> 
   <b> Merging Rows (Vertical Merge):</b>
    To merge multiple rows into a single row, you use the rowspan attribute in the <td> or <th> element of the cell you want to span multiple rows. The rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows the cell should span. <br>

      <b>Example:</b>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="2">Merged Row 1</td>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 3</td>
      <td>Cell 4</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br>
  <li>
  In this example, the first cell in the first row has a rowspan of 2, which means it will span two rows. As a result, "Merged Row 1" will occupy the space of both rows, while the other cells will be in their respective individual rows.  
</li></p>
    <p><b> Merging Columns (Horizontal Merge):</b>
      To merge multiple columns into a single column, you use the colspan attribute in the &lt;td&gt; or &lt;th&gt; element of the cell you want to span multiple columns. The colspan attribute specifies the number of columns the cell should span. <br>
     <br><b>Example:</b>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Cell 1</td>
        <td colspan="2">Merged Column 1 and 2</td>
        <td>Cell 4</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <li>
    In this example, the second cell in the first row has a colspan of 2, which means it will span two columns. As a result, "Merged Column 1 and 2" will occupy the space of both columns, while the other cells will be in their respective individual columns.    
  </li></p> <br>
</ul>

  <h2> Q-11. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h2><hr>
  <p>
      <b>Semantic Tags:</b> Semantic tags are HTML elements that carry meaning and describe the structure of the content within the web page. <br> They provide contextual information about the content, making it easier for search engines, accessibility tools, and other technologies to understand and process the web page. <br> Semantic tags include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; for headings, &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs, &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt; for lists, and so <br> These tags help to organize and structure the content in a meaningful way. <br> <br>
      <b>Presentational Tags:</b> Presentational tags, on the other hand, are HTML elements that are traditionally used for formatting and styling purposes. <br> They were widely used in older versions of HTML to define the appearance of the content but are considered less recommended in modern web development practices. <br> Examples of presentational tags include &lt;b&gt; for bold text, &lt;i&gt; for italic text, &lt;u&gt; for underlined text, &lt;font&gt; for font styles, and so on. <br> Instead of using these tags, it is generally advised to separate the content and presentation by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

  <h2>Q-12.What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2> <hr>
  <p>
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to structure and present content on the web. However, there are some key differences between the two <br>
      <p>Syntax: HTML and XHTML have different syntax rules. HTML is considered more forgiving and allows for some leniency in writin It permits certain sloppy practices, such as omitting closing tags or using uppercase letters for tags and attributes. On the other hand, XHTML follows the stricter syntax rules of XML, requiring well-formed and properly nested tags, lowercase letters for tags and attributes, and the use of closing tags for all <br>
      Parsing: HTML parsers are generally more permissive and can handle imperfectly written code by automatically correcting errors or overlooking them. XHTML parsers, being XML-based, are stricter and less forgiving. They require well-formed code and will produce an error if there are any syntax violations</p>

  <h2>Q-13.What is SVG? </h2> <hr>
  <p>
      1.Scalability: SVG images can be scaled up or down without any loss of quality. This makes them ideal for various purposes, including responsive web design, where graphics need to adapt to different screen sizes. <br>
      2.Vector-based: SVG images are created using geometric shapes, curves, lines, and text, defined by mathematical equations. This allows for precise rendering and manipulation of the image elements. The use of vectors also means that SVG files tend to have smaller file sizes compared to raster images, making them more suitable for web delivery.<br>
      3.XML-based: SVG files are written in XML, a markup language that defines the structure and content of the document. This XML-based format makes SVG images human-readable and allows for easy integration with other XML-based technologies.

    <ul style="background-color: #D3D3D3;" align="left"> 
      1.Normal Links: Normal links, also referred to as "default" or "inactive" links, are the standard state of hyperlinks on a web page. They are typically styled with an underline and a specific color to indicate that they are clickable. <br>
      <b>Example : </b> <br>
      <a href="https://www.example.com">Normal Link</a> <br><hr>
      2.Active Links: Active links represent the state of a hyperlink when a user is actively interacting with it. This state is triggered when the user clicks or presses down on the link but has not released the click or touch yet. <br>
